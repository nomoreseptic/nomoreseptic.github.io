I am anxiously awaiting my Repaper Slate and doing research on SVG, so I can turn paper-and-pencil drawings into SVG images! That means also learning more about SVG.

#### First Notes on SVG

SVG, or scalable vector graphics, uses lines and curves as the basis of images as opposed to raster images whose building blocks are pixels (.gif, .jpg, .png, and jpeg...) This makes SVG scalable without degradation of image qualify as compared to images based on pixels, which become grainy or blurry when scaling larger image due to enlargement of each indivudual pixel. 

##### The basic svg element:
```
<svg 
  version="1.1" 
  baseProfile="full"
  xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
</svg>
```

##### About the SVG Graph

Contrary to traditional graph 'x' and 'y' coordinates, the 'y' coordinates increase in size going in a downward direction, ie point (0,0) is in the upper left corner instead ofthe lower left corner in traditional math classes.

##### g Elements (group)

* for combining elements that shoud share attributes or functionality

##### CSS

* Styling of SVG can be done in CSS.
